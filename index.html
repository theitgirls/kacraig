            Hi! My name is Kate and I am going to be a junior in highschool in Tampa, Florida. I decided to take this class because I knew it would help me get experience in more IT areas. I am mainly interested in cybersecurity, software development, and game development. Outside of school I play club vollleyball and love going to the beach. Sunrise and sunset beach trips are the best! I also like to game with some friends from my school and I love changing my setup and working with my pc. I am so exited to spend two weeks with everyone!
