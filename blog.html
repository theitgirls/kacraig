        <h2> The Code Destroyer: Mary Louise Prather</h2>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 19th, 2022</p>
        
        
         <p> Mary Louise Prather was an American spy, and one of the few women in the cryptography 
            field during the Cold War era and WWII. She joined the SIS in 1938, and worked many
            different jobs in the office, slowly moving up in the office. Finally, in 1940, she reached 
            the position of Chief of the Stenographic section, making her in charge of filing
            intercepted messages. She worked with the messages that were intercepted and worked 
            very secretly to ensure the safety of the country. Mary also helped distribute the 
            decoded messages to the correct people. Her most significant accomplishment was identifying
            a correlation between two different Japanese messages, and using this knowledge to decrypt
            more Japanese encoded messages.

        <h3> The Hunt!</h3>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 20th, 2022</p>
         <p>  
            
            Today we were senton a scavenger hunt. My favorite spot we visited was the dome.
            When we were conducting our interview, we learned all about the new technologies
            that were actively being added into the dome. We then got a tour of the inside of
            the stadium, and we learned about the new wifi being implemented, the screens, audio,
            and more. Syracuse is one of the few univerities able to hold the largest sporting events becasue of these technolgoies. 
            One art that i found very interesting was looking down in the stadium, and seeing the cars parked in the field. 
            This showed me how large the dome actually was, and gave me an object to scale with.
            The whole department uses technology by micro-managing the whole campus, tracking who swipes
            in and out, and managing hundreds of employees.

        <h4> Citizen Science: What I do to Contribute  </h4>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 21th, 2022</p>
        <p>  
            When I was in 7th grade, my science teacher had us use this app called iNauralist. 
            Where any person from the public could post photos of any creature, or plant, and provide a description. 
            Then, real scientists and people who are experts in certain fields could go to your posts and help you 
            identify what you had taken photos of. Along with the images and description, you were required to put the
            location you found the plant or animal. This data was and is being used in many ways and the data is all
            collected by the general public then sent to experts. I participated in this for about a year and a half, and it was really
            exiting to know that by taking a photo of a plant, I was contributing to data that experts were using.
