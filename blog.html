        <h2> The Code Destroyer: Mary Louise Prather</h2>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 19th, 2022</p>
        
        
         <p1> Mary Louise Prather was an American spy, and one of the few women in the cryptography 
            field during the Cold War era and WWII. She joined the SIS in 1938, and worked many
            different jobs in the office, slowly moving up in the office. Finally, in 1940, she reached 
            the position of Chief of the Stenographic section, making her in charge of filing
            intercepted messages. She worked with the messages that were intercepted and worked 
            very secretly to ensure the safety of the country. Mary also helped distribute the 
            decoded messages to the correct people. Her most significant accomplishment was identifying
            a correlation between two different Japanese messages, and using this knowledge to decrypt
            more Japanese encoded messages.
