        <h2> The Code Destroyer: Mary Louise Prather</h2>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 19th, 2022</p>
        
        
         <p> Mary Louise Prather was an American spy, and one of the few women in the cryptography 
            field during the Cold War era and WWII. She joined the SIS in 1938, and worked many
            different jobs in the office, slowly moving up in the office. Finally, in 1940, she reached 
            the position of Chief of the Stenographic section, making her in charge of filing
            intercepted messages. She worked with the messages that were intercepted and worked 
            very secretly to ensure the safety of the country. Mary also helped distribute the 
            decoded messages to the correct people. Her most significant accomplishment was identifying
            a correlation between two different Japanese messages, and using this knowledge to decrypt
            more Japanese encoded messages.

        <h3> The Hunt!</h3>
        <p> Kate Craig / July 20th, 2022</p>
         <p>  
            
            Today we were senton a scavenger hunt. My favorite spot we visited was the dome.
            When we were conducting our interview, we learned all about the new technologies
            that were actively being added into the dome. We then got a tour of the inside of
            the stadium, and we learned about the new wifi being implemented, the screens, audio,
            and more. Syracuse is one of the few univerities able to hold the largest sporting events becasue of these technolgoies. 
            One art that i found very interesting was looking down in the stadium, and seeing the cars parked in the field. 
            This showed me how large the dome actually was, and gave me an object to scale with.
            The whole department uses technology by micro-managing the whole campus, tracking who swipes
            in and out, and managing hundreds of employees.
